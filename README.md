<h2>Recommedation System for Recipes</h2>

This software was created as part of the 2021 HackGT8 hackathon. Using flask as the prototype, given a list of food items, the 
user will be given recipe recommendations. The user will also be given an option to apply filters on the recipe recommendations 
based on allergies or nutrition information such as calories, sodium, and more. 

<h2>Installation</h2>
This software uses the RAW_recipes.csv dataset found at https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions. 
There are also other mandatory dependencies such as NumPy, scikit-learn, Flask, and more that can easily 
be installed via pip. 

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
Using the <A HREF="https://github.com/jackmleitch/Whatscooking-"> Whats Cooking Recommendation</A> repo, our team was able to
integrate the cosine similarity algorithm towards our dataset.
